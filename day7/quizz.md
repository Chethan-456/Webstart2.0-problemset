# Create a simple quiz web page:

## What to do:
Uses HTML to structure the page with a container to display a question and multiple-choice answers as radio buttons, plus a Submit button.

Styles the question and answers using CSS to ensure clear readability and an attractive, user-friendly layout.

Uses JavaScript with DOM manipulation to dynamically display one question at a time inside the container.

## Adds an event listener to the Submit button to:

Capture the userâ€™s selected answer from the radio buttons.

Verify the answer and display immediate feedback (correct or wrong) on the page.

Update the DOM to load the next question automatically until all questions are answered.
